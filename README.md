# firefox-flexoki-dynamic-theme
Dynamic theme for firefox using the flexoki color scheme.  
More about flexoki: [Website](https://stephango.com/flexoki), [GitHub](https://github.com/kepano/flexoki)  

This contains a light and a dark theme. The light theme is shown between 7am and 10pm.

## Installation
Install the [dynamic theme addon](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/flexoki-dynamic-theme/).
Alternatively, install only [the light theme](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/flexoki-light/) or only [the dark theme](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/flexoki-dark/).

## Contribution
Since this is my first try at a firefox theme/extension, I used [Firefox Color](https://color.firefox.com/) and copied the resulting color object into the dynamic theme extension example described [here](https://extensionworkshop.com/documentation/themes/dynamic-themes/).

If there are better ways to achieve similar results or I missed something, I really appreciate Issues or even a Pull Requests.

## Disclaimer
I mostly stuck to the flexoki color scheme as described on the [Website](https://stephango.com/flexoki). However, I made the text colors in the dark theme 2 tones lighter for better contrast and readability. Also there might be alternative ways to use the colors that might look even better. Feel free to discuss changes in an Issue.
